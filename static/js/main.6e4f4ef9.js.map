First, if your favorite eatery doesn't deliver, it's not going to show up in DelivR.</p>  \r\n\t\t<p>Second, if Yelp's Fusion API doesn't have your favorite eatery listed with the transaction type 'delivery', it also won't show up in the results.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>Next, if the location doesn't have any reviews on Yelp, it won't show up in DelivR.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>Lastly, check your spelling.  If you've spelled what you're looking for correctly and the location or zipcode is correct, there may not be a delivery place available for you.  Try a different type of food.</p>\r\n\t\t<h3>I know that there are places that deliver 'insert cuisine type here' so why isn't anything showing up in the results?</h3>\r\n\t\t<p>Unfortunately, if a restaurant is not listed in the Yelp Fusion API as having a transaction type of 'delivery', it will not show up in DelivR's search results.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>Don't be too specific in your search terms for cuisine.
