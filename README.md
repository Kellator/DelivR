## Developed as the capstone project for Thinkful Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp React/Redux Unit.
### Introduction to DelivR
Delivr allows a user to search the Yelp Fusion API for a restaurant that delivers food to wherever you are.  Currently, Delivr works in the United States.
Search for what you're hungry for by entering the cuisine type (Pizza) and your current location or zipcode (Boston, MA)
If the type of cuisine you're looking for is not available in your location, you will be prompted to try again with different search criteria.
### Usecase:  Why is DelivR useful?
Have you ever started a new job, moved to a new location, or maybe you're just starting out at college and you're hungry?  You don't know what's around to eat
but you could really go for some General Tso's or a BBQ Chicken Pizza.  DelivR will allow you to put in the type of cuisine you're hungry for (Chinese, Pizza, etc) and your current location (City, State or zipcode) and let you know if there is someone who delivers that type of food to where you are.  DelivR is made to work on mobile or desktop devices and you can even place a call to the restaurant by clicking on the phone number link.  DelivR even provides you with a simple star rating to help you decide which restaurant will deliver the best dinner for you.
### UX
DelivR was designed with simplicity in mind.  No one wants a complicated interface when they are hungry.  Simple input fields, large easy to read buttons, and click-to-call links make DelivR easy to use.
